# Welcome to Recipeasy!

www.carlpton.co.uk/recipeasy

This is a app I currentl develop in my spare time to help keep my React skills up to date as well as practice new techniques, It's the first app I've actually managed to get deployed and live in my spare time rather than fallen by the wayside in a unfinsihed project graveyard (a.k.a the rest of my github profile).

The main idea behind Recipeasy is an app you can use to easily search through a number of recipes and save them for future use (eventually), what would be cool if I ever get round to it is it will also allow you to add the ingredients for the recipe to the online basket of your food provider of choice.

## Goals & Objectives

* Keep up to date with React, as a massive fan who unfortunately doesn't do enough of it, I used this project as a means to improve and maintain my front end skills, because when you get it right it really is fun.

* To only try and use a new library or framework if I really needed it, for example made the conscious decision to not use Redux as I felt for an app with this level of complexity it was overkill, I instead opted to use the react context api which the React team exposed in React 16.

* Try and keep accessibility and usuability in the forefront of my mind when designing this app, this is an area which I'm often guilty of overlooking so really wanted to try and make this app as accessable as possible

* To learn the full process of setting up a webs erver to host my app, this included using linux as well as setting up a domain and everything inbetween.

## What didn't go so well

* Design with mobile first in mind, you know that, I know that, so why didn't I? Think in the excitement to get going just powered on with a desktop screen size in mind. I have a app which for the most part I'm proud of the design until I tried to view it on my mobile. I always had in the back of my mind that it wouldn't look great on a smaller screen size and am rectifying that now but would of been a lot easier if I just kept this in mind from the get go.

* Not using a CSS preprocessor, due to the smaller amount of css you use for each component I thought I could get away with just using vanilla CSS however I found myself missing nexted CSS rules, variables and mixins which you get with Sass.
